Often at organisations, we have to send emails to multiple recipients. Sometimes it is within the organisation, sometimes out of the organisation. 
Send_Mail lets you send emails to various recipients. 
*pre-requisite: prepare an excel sheet with emails and contents you want you want to add.

Read_Mail helps in downloading attachments in the folders based on subject of the mail. I.e. the code will create folders in the directory uniquely identified by the subject line mentioned in the email.
